    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The recipe is for classic homemade waffles, which can be easily made from scratch. It uses simple ingredients such as all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, buttermilk, unsalted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract
        To make the waffles, the dry ingredients are combined in a large mixing bowl, while the wet ingredients are mixed in a separate mixing bowl. The wet ingredients are then added to the dry ingredients and mixed until just combined. It's important not to overmix the batter, as this can result in tough waffles.
        The waffle iron is preheated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using a ladle or measuring cup, the batter is scooped onto the waffle iron, and cooked until golden brown and crispy. The waffles can be served hot with a variety of toppings such as butter, syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.
        The resulting waffles are fluffy, tender, and delicious. This recipe is a great option for breakfast or brunch, and can be easily customized with different toppings to suit your taste preferences.</p>
